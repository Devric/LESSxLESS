LESSxLESS

demo: http://devric.co.cc

About:
| This framework is based on less.js
| It is suitable for front end designers! NOT developers, it only provides 
  basic style and helpers classes/mixings.
| The classes that work straight out of the box are the modules and the basic site layout, everything else is mixings

Features:
| fluid grid( max 16, default 12, set in style.css )
| modular based ( can be light as 8kbs or full powered )
| ongoing development in mixings
| super flexible
| elastic design for multiple resolutions

use:
| mac: less.app
| win/ubuntu: node.js compiler
| or just use less.js ( not recommanded )

browse sample:
Note, if you are using a webkit browser( chrome, safari ) 
you will need to browse with a server(or localhost) due to the samples are in 
seperate files and load via ajax.

currently in development stage, but feel free to use.

classes/mixing are listed within note.txt for rapid LESSing

Have fun

update:
| remove less used media queries

plugins:
| sexy_btn
| pulse_btn
| hex_btn (using dingbats)
