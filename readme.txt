Features:

| modular based ( can be light as 8kbs or full powered )
| ongoing development in mixings
| super flexible
| elastic design for multiple resolutions

use:
| mac: less.app
| win/ubuntu: node.js compiler
| or just use less.js ( not recommanded )

browse sample:
Note, if you are using a webkit browser( chrome, safari ) 
you will need to browse with a server(or localhost) due to the samples are in 
seperate files and load via ajax.

currently in development stage, but feel free to use.

Have fun
